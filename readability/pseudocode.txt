longer words probably correlate with higher reading levels. Likewise, longer sentences probably correlate with higher reading levels, too
Coleman-Liau index of a text:
index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
L = the average number of letters / 100 words
S = the average number of sentences / 100 words in the text

Program Specification:
program must prompt the user for a string of text using get_string
program should count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text
You may assume that a letter is any lowercase character from a to z or any uppercase character from A to Z, any sequence of characters separated by spaces should count as a word
and that any occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark indicates the end of a sentence.
program should print as output "Grade X" where X is the grade level computed by the Coleman-Liau formula, rounded to the nearest integer
If the resulting index number is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), your program should output "Grade 16+" instead of giving the exact index number.
If the index number is less than 1, your program should output "Before Grade 1"
